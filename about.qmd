Hi, I’m Nivedita — a Senior Data Scientist with a background in physics, computational modeling, and large-scale data systems. I’ve worked extensively across healthcare, biotech, and research labs, blending data engineering with deep learning and statistical modeling.

On this blog, I share real-world tutorials, hands-on notebooks, and lessons I’ve learned while solving data problems in production. My aim is to make complex topics digestible — whether it's Dask, NLP with Transformers, or robust ML pipelines.
