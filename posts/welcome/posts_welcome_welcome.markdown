## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to add two numbers in Python using a simple function. Itâ€™s perfect for beginners learning basic programming concepts.

## Python Code

Below is a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

```{python}
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {result}")
```

The code:
1. Defines a function `add_numbers` that accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`.
2. Returns their sum using `a + b`.
3. Demonstrates the function with `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 20`, printing the result.

When you run this code, the output is:
```
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
```

## Try It Yourself

Copy the code into your Python environment or modify the numbers to test different inputs. Stay tuned for more Python tutorials!
